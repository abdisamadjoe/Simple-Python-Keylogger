## YouTube Demonstration
[Link to YouTube Demonstration](#)

## Project Description
This project demonstrates a simple Python keylogger that captures and logs keystrokes. The keylogger is designed to run in the background and save the keystrokes to a file named `log.txt`. The script uses the `pynput` library to listen to keyboard events and record the keys pressed.

## Code Running
To run the keylogger, save the script as `keylogger.py` and execute it using Python:

# Password Complexity Checker

### [YouTube Demonstration](https://youtu.be/gPJyF8NFo_g?si=6xdbhE_5vFvnW6XZ)

## Description
This project is a Python-based tool that assesses the complexity of passwords. It evaluates the strength of a password based on criteria such as length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. The tool then provides feedback, classifying the password as strong, moderate, or weak based on the criteria met.

## Languages and Utilities Used

- **Python**

## Environments Used 

- **Windows 11**
- **Visual Studio Code**

</p>

## How It Works:
- **Length**: At least 8 characters.
- **Uppercase**: Includes one uppercase letter.
- **Lowercase**: Includes one lowercase letter.
- **Number**: Contains at least one digit.
- **Special Character**: Includes one special character (e.g., `!@#$%^&*()`).

## Usage
1. **Run the Script**: Input your password when prompted.
2. **View Feedback**: The script will return whether your password is weak, moderate, or strong based on the criteria.
