## Project Description
This project demonstrates a simple Python keylogger that captures and logs keystrokes. The keylogger is designed to run in the background and save the keystrokes to a file named `log.txt`. The script uses the `pynput` library to listen to keyboard events and record the keys pressed.

## Code Running
To run the keylogger, save the script as `keylogger.py` and execute it using Python:
```bash
python keylogger.py
